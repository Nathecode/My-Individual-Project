<h1> Parallel Computing </h1>

 <p> 

	According to classification from, <strong> Wikipedia</strong> - <em> Parrallel Computing</ em> is a type of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller operations which are then solved at the same time. There are several different forms of <i> parrellel computational </i>; <a href="bit-level.html">bit-level</a>, <a href="instruction-level computing">instruction-level</a>, and <a href="#parallelism/task parallelism.html">task parallelism</a>
